The Project Structure Explained
/myproject: This is the main container for our entire project.

requirements.txt: This file lists all the Python packages our project needs to run (like FastAPI, Uvicorn, etc.). It's like a recipe's ingredient list.

/app: This is the heart of our application. All our actual Python code will live inside this directory.

Let's look inside the /app directory:

/api: This is where we define the API endpoints (the URLs, like /todos/ or /users/). It handles incoming web requests and sends back responses.

/core: This holds our project's configuration, like database connection details or secret keys.

/db: This is where we'll put the logic for connecting to our PostgreSQL database.

/models: This directory will contain our database table structures, defined as Python classes.

/schemas: This holds our data validation models (using Pydantic). It defines what the data should look like when it comes into and goes out of our API.

main.py: This is the entry point that starts our entire FastAPI application. It ties everything together.

This separation makes our code clean, easy to test, and ready to grow.
